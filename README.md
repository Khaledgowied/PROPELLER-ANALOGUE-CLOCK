# PROPELLER-ANALOGUE-CLOCK
Propeller Clock is a clock, displayed by a mechanically rotating bar of Light Emitting Diodes (LED s).
In the display, the LED s are not illuminated constantly.The LED s turn on and off at precise intervals, one after another,
extremely rapidly while being rotated with several thousands of rounds per minute (RPM). Human eye is an integrating optical sensor
that has about 0.1 s integration time. Hence, the human eye, registers an image as an integral of photons reached to the eye about 0.1 s
time. This phenomena is known as Persistence of Vision (POV) that gives the illusion of a static stable display.
POV of human eye has been used as the basic principle in this project.
